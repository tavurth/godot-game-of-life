* Background

I found it difficult to track down a simple GPU version of the Game of Life in Godot so I built one as part of a step in another project.

This project uses only shaders to calculate the previous & next steps for the cellular automata. GDscript is used here only to input mouse coordinates & button presses for drawing.

* Development notes

It's important to set the ~viewport -> Render Target~ to have it's clear mode set to ~Next Frame~, in that way we will keep the contents of the FBO for the next frame, which will use those points to render the next step.

I guess this method could also be used in compute shaders.

If you would like to try out different rules, you can check the [[./GameOfLife.shader][GameOfLife.shader]] file, (~vec4 getColor~)
